<h1>How Long Is the Usual Feature-Length Film Script?</h1>

<p>Writing a feature-length film script can feel like a daunting task. But when you understand the structure and pacing that most scripts follow, it becomes easier to tackle. For beginners wondering how long a script should be, the industry norm is <strong>90 to 120 pages</strong>. This range aligns with the typical runtime of feature films, but the genre, pacing, and content can influence the final length.</p>

<p>In this blog, we’ll break down script length by genre, discuss how to pace scenes effectively, and explore how formatting plays a role. Lastly, we’ll share how tools like <strong>Screenplay Writer</strong> can help you plan and write your screenplay right inside <strong>Google Docs</strong>, leveraging its collaboration features and ease of use.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Standard Length</h2>

<h3>Why 90–120 Pages?</h3>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that <strong>one page equals one minute of screen time</strong>, so a 90-page script translates to a 90-minute movie. Here's a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>90 pages:</strong> Common for comedies or animation—stories that are punchy and fast-paced.</li>
    <li><strong>120 pages:</strong> Usually reserved for dramas, action, or stories with complex narratives.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Stick to This Range?</h3>
<p>Producers and filmmakers expect scripts to fit this framework because it reflects decades of industry experience. Straying too far from these norms might signal inexperience, especially if you're pitching your script for production.</p>

<h2>Breaking It Down: Structure and Scene Timing</h2>

<h3>The Three-Act Structure</h3>
<p>Most feature films follow the tried-and-tested <strong>three-act structure</strong>:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Act 1 (Setup):</strong> Introduce characters, settings, and conflicts. (Pages 1–30)</li>
    <li><strong>Act 2 (Confrontation):</strong> Escalate challenges and raise stakes. (Pages 30–90)</li>
    <li><strong>Act 3 (Resolution):</strong> Resolve conflicts and tie up loose ends. (Pages 90–120)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Scene Length</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dialogue-heavy scenes:</strong> Often 2–3 pages long, with snappy exchanges.</li>
    <li><strong>Action sequences:</strong> Typically shorter—1 page or even half a page—due to quick pacing.</li>
    <li><strong>Exposition or setup scenes:</strong> Can run longer, around 3–5 pages, depending on complexity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Genre Examples: How Length Varies</h2>

<h3>Comedy (90–100 pages)</h3>
<p>Comedies often keep things short and snappy, with fewer subplots.</p>
<em>Example:</em> <strong>“Bridesmaids” (101 pages)</strong>—Balances humor with character-driven moments.

<h3>Action/Adventure (110–120 pages)</h3>
<p>Action scripts focus heavily on descriptions of stunts and sequences.</p>
<em>Example:</em> <strong>“Mad Max: Fury Road” (113 pages)</strong>—Uses vivid action descriptions to create immersive scenes.

<h3>Drama (120 pages)</h3>
<p>Dramas rely on depth and emotional complexity, often requiring longer screen time.</p>
<em>Example:</em> <strong>“The Social Network” (162 pages)</strong>—Heavy on dialogue but intricately structured.

<h3>Thriller (90–110 pages)</h3>
<p>Thrillers demand tighter pacing to maintain tension and suspense.</p>
<em>Example:</em> <strong>“A Quiet Place” (67 pages)</strong>—Relies on minimal dialogue and detailed visuals.

<h2>How Formatting Impacts Script Length</h2>

<p>Proper formatting is crucial for clarity and pacing. The industry-standard format ensures your script is easy to read and professionally presented:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Font:</strong> Always use 12-point Courier.</li>
    <li><strong>Margins:</strong> Left margin of 1.5 inches, right margin of 1 inch.</li>
    <li><strong>Scene Headings:</strong> Include details like location and time (e.g., INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT).</li>
    <li><strong>Action Descriptions:</strong> Keep them concise but visually engaging.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialogue:</strong> Centered on the page, with character names in uppercase.</li>
</ul>
